Review

- Paging: why is it awesome?
- Paging: why is it bad? (too slow, PTs too big)

Today
- Gonna make paging FAST!
- How? Hardware support w/ the poorly named TLB!
  (should be an "address translation cache" or ATC but oh well!)

Some important points to make:
- Key to understand that contents of PTE are not the same as contents of TLB
  (e.g., valid bit is a good example: in TLB it refers to whether there is
   a valid translation in a particular TLB slot; in the PTE it refers to
   whether that page of the address space is legal for the process to access)

- Key to understand "H/W managed" approach
  How hardware does all the work
  How OS has to conform to H/W-defined page table structure

- Key to understand "S/W managed" approach
  Adds some complexity to OS
  Removes much from hardware
  Adds new instructions too

Standard blackboard lecture; see NOTES.pdf.

One handout for class, usually done as a kind of "quiz" at the beginning of
the lecture, to see if they're getting the base/bounds stuff. It is included
as vm-relocation-review.txt or .pdf. Use if you want to see how perilously
little the students have learned thus far!

Review
- What we're trying to do: VIRTUALIZE MEMORY, provide the great illusion
  of your own private space to store stuff

- Early approaches: base/bounds, segmentation
  (now easy to summarize these quickly)

  Ask about: when is hardware involved? when is OS involved?
  (and then discuss this key to efficiency and protection)

- Finally, what was wrong with the previous approaches?
  (still not super flexible, external fragmentation, etc.)

Introduce

- Ancient technique of paging
  Describe basic ideas, show some pictures of how AS, phys mem get chopped up

- Do example (included, or some other simple one)
  I always use really simple, small address spaces so everything is easy to
  visualize (as well as draw on the board!)
  Make this as detailed and slow as possible, really driving
  home how it works

  Show where page table is too(!) - in memory

  Describe all the necessary terms here (page tables, PTEs, etc.)
  Students need to get comfortable with these words, so
    you have to keep saying them!  

  Go through OS involvement
  When does OS have to alloc pages? 
  (new process, growing the heap, process exit, etc.)

- End with BIG PROBLEMS:
  paging too slow
  page tables too big
  This sets up the next TWO lectures nicely

This is a pretty hard lecture for undergrads, so you
have to build up a bit slowly.

First, show the problem: even with "disk awareness"
(like you find in FFS), you have a problem: lots of 
small writes to non-contiguous locales.

(you can use this part to review FFS a bit too,
and how caching solves the problem for reads,
but not so much for writes)

Then, show the real goal: pure sequential access.
For reads this is hard (because who knows what 
the user will want to read next)
For writes, it is possible, because you can
shape write traffic - as long as you don't
have to overwrite anything in place.

And thus the key:

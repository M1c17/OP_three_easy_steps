Another review type thing to do, this time just a few concrete problems. First
I let the class do them. Then I walk through them with the class. 

The first problem is just a simple paging problem. 

The second one is straight from the homework simulator for the multi-level
page table. I often do this with them, tell them repeatedly to study it, and
then have it as an exam question (of course, with a different,
randomly-generated page table via the simulator). There is just something
awesome about throwing a dump of memory at the students and seeing them make
sense of it.

Of course, one could always just assign these type of problems as homeworks,
but sometimes doing such things together, in class, is nice.

Sometimes I have covered the VAX/VMS chapter as a review, so I include
some notes on that paper in here too (NOTES-vax.pdf).

semaphores
- sem-def.c         : how a semaphore works

using semaphore as a lock (BINARY semaphore):
- sem-lock.c        : code w/o locks
- sem-lock-works.c  : code w/ semaphore as lock

using semaphore to signal:
- sem-join.c        : join problem again
- sem-join-works.c  : join problem using semaphores

writing your own semaphore  
- zemaphore.h       : using cond vars + locks
- sem-myown-lock.h  : using zemaphores as locks

read/write lock (if time)
- rwlock.c          : working thing

[probably next time below here]

bounded buffer problem:
- sem-pc.c          : same old problem
- sem-pc-signals.c  : uses signaling to solve problem
- sem-pc-locks.c    : adds a lock too 
- sem-pc-works.c    : actually works
- sem-myown-pc.c    : using zemaphores in PC problem

Detailed notes in NOTES.pdf

Somewhere in the past year or two I've been squeezing in a detailed review of
how paging works, with lots of diagrams of what is going on in the CPU and
memory, as a way to make sure the students understand and have a good
visualization of what is going on. These notes represent the latest version of
this review, which doesn't take a whole class, but does take a bit of time.

One day perhaps this will turn into some kind of animation, but until then,
you are the animator! Show them how much work it is just to execute an
instruction (particularly a load or store!), and do all the math with the
PTBR, etc.

In Eden fair did Adam and Eve
live in perfect harmony.

“No plant or animal devoureth we,
only ripe fruit as falls from the tree.”

By bright-green lily-pads in sphagnum bogs
the herons waded gracefully,
bullfrogs croaked their deep, clear calls;
bluebells, delicate yellow buttercups
were rampant; larks sang in the mulberries.

“No pain or hunger knew we there,
only the sameness of Eden fair.”

Even the bounty, the beauty, the civility,
the rich perfection, stretching out like the wall
of the great oval garden, day after day,
year after year to eternity,
grew tiresome.

“No shame in our nakedness knew we …
nor lust, nor desire, nor carnality.”

It’s the exogamous, the unfamiliar,
which stirs in us the deepest passion,
the basso continuo of mortality
which gives to desire its piquancy
–of which they knew nothing in deathless Eden.

“We wanted to look outside the wall.
We didn’t mean from God’s grace to fall.”

Their lack of control, their disrespect
invited tragedy….
But to deny what one feels,
to deny what one is
is to risk even greater calamity….

“God expelled us from the Garden.
Now we’ll know death and all that’s human.”

Discord … despair…. Are you better off?
Coaxing grain from the cracked, parched earth?
Maybe you paid too much for your freedom?…
Maybe you wish you were back in the Garden?…

“There be good inside the Garden;
there be good outside….
There is no perfect Eden.”

FOUR CONDITIONS MUST HOLD FOR DEADLOCK TO OCCUR

mutual exclusion: 
  thread can hold resource and exclude others from it
  when others request resource, they are delayed

hold-and-wait pattern:
  thread holds resource, then may wait for another

no preemption of resource is allowed: 
  once resource is held, not released 

circular wait:
  T1 -> T2 -> ... -> TN -> T1
  (thread 1 waits for thread 2 waits for ... )
  if represented as graph, there is a cycle

  T1 -> T2 
     <-

Focus: Prevention
  prevent: attack one condition and thus prevent deadlock

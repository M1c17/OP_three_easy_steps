This lecture has two parts: the first in which we discuss the basics of
devices, and the second in which we focus on hard disk drives.

The first part is usually done quickly: while it is good to go over these
things, it is somewhat straightforward and thus not super exciting
material. Start with the generic device protocol, and then introduce things
like interrupts and DMA as solutions to specific problems (i.e., that of
excessive CPU overheads).

The second part is more fun: how hard disks work. It is not a bad idea to show
a short video of the internals of hard drive operation (many are available on
youtube) to start out, and to provide a little bit of fresh air.

Then describe the basics, including things like platters, spindles, etc. Make
sure a little math is done to show how one can estimate performance for
different workload types. For example, a great contrast is how much different
in performance a stream of random, small I/Os perform compared to a sequential
I/O (or large I/Os). 

Finally, discuss disk scheduling. You likely won't have a ton of time to cover
this, but the basics are easy. You can likely get students to figure out most
of the basic strategies drives take, including consideration of both seek and
even rotation in deciding what to schedule next.

Each directory represents roughly one 75-minute lecture, as taught at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Within each directory, you'll see:
- README - some more details about the lecture
- NOTES.pdf - a scan of my handwritten notes which I bring to class
- Some code or other handouts, as needed

(there are some directories with just NOTES.pdf in them; I have not yet added
the other stuff to those, but will soon!)

The general way I prepare for class is by looking over the last set of notes I
wrote, and then writing out a new version of the same notes, making sure to
think carefully through the examples I'll be using in class. I find that by
doing this I generally (a) work out most kinks and (b) get enough of the
lecture in my head so as to not really need the notes.

Also a nice idea to review a bit from last time and connect it to the current
lecture, to provide some continuity. Many of the notes include such reviewing
hints, but probably not all. Helps also because sometimes students just don't
get it, or weren't there, etc.

Also, check back from time-to-time; I've been updating some of these and hence
the notes, READMEs, and other pieces might change (hopefully, for the better).

Hope these are helpful!
